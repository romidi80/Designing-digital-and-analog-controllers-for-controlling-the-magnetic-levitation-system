# Designing-digital-and-analog-controllers-for-controlling-the-magnetic-levitation-system
In this project, we designed analog and digital controllers for controlling the magnetic levitation system and compared their performances.

This repository is dedicated to the design and implementation of various digital and analog controllers for a magnetic levitation system. Magnetic levitation (maglev) systems are used in various applications, including transportation, stabilization, and more. The goal of this project is to explore and compare different control strategies to achieve stable levitation and control of the system.

The magnetic levitation system consists of one or more magnets and an object that is levitated by the magnetic field. The challenge is to maintain the levitated object at a desired position while considering disturbances, nonlinearities, and uncertainties in the system.

In this repository, we explore various controller designs, including both digital and analog approaches. These controllers aim to regulate the position of the levitated object. More details about how the controllers were designed is shown in the report file.
